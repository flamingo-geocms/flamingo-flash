To run the flamingo examples you need to do 2 things.
1) Copy the examples to a http accessible folder
2) Copy the flamingo build in the flamingo folder.


1)
To run the flamingo examples you need to make sure the examples directory is accessible through http protocol.
To accomplish this you need to place content of the example directory in a web folder.

For example:
/<Apache Directory>/htdocs/flamingo_examples/
So the examples index page is accessible through the following url:
http://localhost/flamingo_examples/


2)
The examples folder is missing the flamingo build. You need to copy that from the zip file you downloaded.
Normally its located in the <zip file root>/flamingo
Copy the content of that directory to the flamingo directory in the example folder that's created in step 1.

For example:
/<Apache Directory>/htdocs/flamingo_examples/flamingo
